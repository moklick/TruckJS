Runing these examples
=====================

By default these examples are using the iOS theme. You can change the theme by changing the reference to the stylesheet the example uses. Possible choices are:

  1. truck-ios.css
  2. truck-ios.css
  3. truck-ios.css

You can run these examples on the following desktop browsers for testing:

  Mac: Safari, Chrome
  Windows: IE10, IE11, MSEdge, Chrome

There are a couple of things to note about running themes in these browsers. The windows theme uses Microsoft features for the busy and range input. Other browsers will not show these properly.
Sheet for Android and iOS use CSS filters to blur the background. These are not supported on IE or MSEdge.

Other than that, your layouts should render fairly accurately on different browsers.

The folder `fetch` has examples of using the Fetch API for remote data access. The examples are using PHP and so require a running PHP server. We just used MAMP for this, putting the folder in a PHP htdocs directory.
